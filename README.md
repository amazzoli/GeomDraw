Unity asset for drawing lines, curves and poligons on 2D sprites in Unity. 
It includes simple C# functions for drawings from script and an editor window that calls them.

### Features
- All the rendered lines and shape borders are antialiased
- Draw broken lines
- Draw cubic Bezier curves
- Draw regular poligons
- Draw poligons given an arbitrary set of vertices. It handles intersections of the sides by drawing the non-intersecting external path following them
- Draw circles and ellipses
- Draw shapes whose perimeter is composed on an arbitrary list of broken lines and/or Bezier curves (only from code)
- Bucket tool
